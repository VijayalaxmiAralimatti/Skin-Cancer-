# Skin Cancer Detection with CNN / Deep Learning

## 📄 Overview  
This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for detecting skin cancer from dermoscopic / skin lesion images. The goal is to build a system that can classify skin lesions (benign vs malignant / different skin-cancer types) using deep learning, helping support early detection and diagnosis.

## 🚀 How to Run / Usage  

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shubhamjaiswal54/SKIN_CANCER.git  
   cd SKIN_CANCER  
````

2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment and activate it

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
4. Prepare / place your skin lesion images in the expected input folder or path (refer to Notebook / code).
5. Run the training / inference notebook or `main.py` to train the model or predict on new images.

## 📊 What it Does

* Preprocesses skin lesion images (resizing, normalization, augmentation if used).
* Uses a CNN-based deep learning model to classify skin lesions.
* Outputs predictions (benign vs malignant / classes), and optionally visualizations / probabilities.
* Enables experimentation — you can adjust hyperparameters, data splits, augmentation, network architecture, etc.

## 🧪 Inspiration & References

This project is inspired by existing research on automated skin cancer / skin-lesion classification using deep learning. For example:

* The work “Skin Lesion Analyser: An Efficient Seven-Way Multi-Class Skin Cancer Classification Using MobileNet” demonstrates that deep-learning based classification of skin lesions can achieve high accuracy, often comparable to dermatologists. ([arXiv][1])
* Several studies show CNN-based detection systems can reduce dependence on manual biopsy / dermoscopic diagnosis and support early detection workflows in dermatology. ([arXiv][2])

Feel free to explore, adapt, or extend this code for research, educational use, or as a starting point for more advanced skin-cancer detection pipelines.

## ✅ Possible Improvements & To-Do

* Expand dataset: add more dermoscopic images (benign, malignant, multiple classes) to improve model generalization.
* Data augmentation and preprocessing refinements (e.g. color normalization, lesion segmentation).
* Experiment with advanced architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, transfer learning, attention mechanisms) to boost accuracy and robustness.
* Add evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves) and possibly cross-validation.
* Build a simple web or GUI interface for easier inference / demonstration.
